<p>
				☛ Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, the full name of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam.
				<br><br>
				☛ From 2002 to 2007, he held the position of the 11th President of India.
				<br><br>
				☛ After obtaining a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam became a part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958.
				<br><br>
				☛He shifted to the Indian Space Research Organisation in 1969 and served as the project director for the SLV-III. It was the first satellite launch vehicle that India had independently designed and manufactured.
				<br><br>
				☛ After rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam strategized and executed a program that resulted in the development of several effective missiles, a feat that led to him being famously referred to as the <strong> “Missile Man.”</strong>
				<br><br> 
				☛ One of the achievements was the development of <strong>Agni</strong>, India's inaugural intermediate-range ballistic missile that integrated some features of the SLV-III and was first tested in 1989.
				<br><br> 
				☛ He played a crucial part in organizing, providing technical expertise, and navigating the political landscape during India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which were the first tests conducted by India since its initial nuclear test in 1974.
				<br><br> 
				☛ Between 1992 and 1997, Kalam held the position of scientific adviser to the defense minister. Later, he was appointed as the principal scientific adviser (1999-2001) to the government, with the status of a cabinet minister.
				<br><br> 
				☛ In the year 1998, India's nuclear weapons tests were a significant event that established Kalam as a national hero due to his notable involvement, but it also caused considerable concern in the global community. These tests cemented India's position as a nuclear power.
				<br><br> 
				☛ Kalam introduced a nationwide strategy named Technology Vision 2020 in 1998, with the aim of converting India into a developed nation within two decades, by providing a roadmap for social and economic transformation. This plan involved multiple initiatives such as improving agricultural output, promoting technology as a driver for economic progress, and enhancing the reach of healthcare and education.
				<br><br> 
				☛ Kalam received <b>7</b>
				honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
				universities. The Government of India
				honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
				in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
				in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
				DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
				to the Government.
				<br><br> 
				☛ Kalam was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour in India, in 1997 for his efforts in advancing scientific research and modernizing defense technology in the country.
				<br><br> 
				☛ The National Space Society awarded him the Von Braun Award in 2013, which acknowledges exceptional management and leadership of a space-related project.
				<br><br> 
				☛ On the 27th of July 2015, at the age of 83, Kalam suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away after collapsing while giving a speech at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.
				<br><br> 
				☛ Wheeler Island, a
				national missile test site in Odisha, was
				renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
				2015.
				<br><br> 
				☛ A prominent road in
				New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
				Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
				in August 2015.
				<br><br> 
				☛ A plant species that was newly discovered was named Drypetes kalamii by scientists from the Botanical Survey of India in February 2018, as a tribute to him.
